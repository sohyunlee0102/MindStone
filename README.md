## What I Did

   Developed habit reminders that notify users at their preferred times.

   Improved my knowledge of Git Flow, enhancing my understanding of branch strategies for team collaboration.

4. **Code Readability**  
   Focused on writing clear and maintainable code so that team members could easily understand and build on it.

5. **Security Practices**  
   Strengthened my ability to design secure systems by using Spring Security for role-based access control, token management, and CORS configuration.
